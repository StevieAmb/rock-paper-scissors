## Future Features

- For future use, I would love it to have a spell showing in Latin when the
human player chooses a fighter, and wins!

- I would love to have another spell show up when the computer/witch wins.

- I would also love to have another tagline show when there is a tie that says
"Are you a wizard/witch or not?"

## Technologies Used

- Google Chrome
- Github
- Terminal
- Atom

Languages:

- HTML
- CSS

## Code Architecture

- This project utilizes the DATA MODEL and the DOM. The DOM is an area of
existence that lives up on top of the HTML, and the DATA MODEL is made up of
data that we can pull to update what is shown on the DOM/web page.

- There are:
   - One HTML file (for the hard-coded HTML)
   - One CSS file, where we can do our styling and layout for the page.
   - There is one main JS page that has everything we need in order to update
   the web page, and make it dynamic based on user interaction.
   - There is the two classes
     - The Game Class, which has two instances of the Player Class, and
     ultimately holds the game logic and how it's supposed to be played.
     - The Player Class, which holds what the player is meant to be doing, and
     the things that each player instance is able to do.

## Challenges

- This entire project was challenging, to be quite frank. I think the hardest
thing for me, though, was organizing all of my code once I got all of the
pieces down. Even though I am able to think about all the pieces I may need, I
tend to struggle with organizing them, or knowing where things must go sometimes.

## Wins

- I am proud that I made something that works, and you can actually play a game
on it. I am also proud I got to add my own spin on it, and sort of personalize
it to be something that I would enjoy playing.

- I am ALSO proud to say that this project, I was taught about slowing down. I
generate thought at a very rapid pace, but I process much slower, so I learned
that I actually need to slow my thoughts down, and look at my code slowly, and
rubber duck slowly and in a more controlled manner, which really helps me see
the code and the organizing of it a lot better. I am very proud of having
someone teach me this, and then making it a point to take that I learned and
apply it to my learning and producing and seeing the immediate results of that
process and how it helps my understanding.
