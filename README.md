a challenge edge to it.


## Future Features

- For future use, I would love it to have a spell showing in Latin when the
human player chooses a fighter, and wins!

- I would love to have another spell show up when the computer/witch wins.

- I would also love to have another tagline show when there is a tie that says
"Are you a wizard/witch or not?"
